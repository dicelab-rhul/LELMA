This situation is a classic example of a coordination game where mutual outcomes can vary based on the choices made by both players. To determine the best choice, we should consider the possible strategies and outcomes.

Let's break down possible scenarios and payoffs:

1. **Both choose R:**
   - My payoff: $1
   - Their payoff: $1

2. **I choose R, they choose B:**
   - My payoff: $3
   - Their payoff: $0

3. **I choose B, they choose R:**
   - My payoff: $0
   - Their payoff: $3

4. **Both choose B:**
   - My payoff: $5
   - Their payoff: $5
   
Analysing these outcomes, we note that:

- If I choose R, I get either $1 or $3.
- If I choose B, I get either $0 or $5.

Choosing R might seem attractive because thereâ€™s a guaranteed payoff of at least $1, but thinking from a broader perspective, both players choosing B results in a much better outcome for both. 

Given that the optimal strategy involves mutual cooperation and trust that the other player is also analyzing the game rationally, the best payoff for both of us would be if we both choose B. 

From a game theory standpoint, if I anticipate that the other player is reasoning similarly and aiming for the higher mutual payoff, choosing B (which gives $5 to each) is the rational choice.

Therefore, after analyzing the potential payoff matrix, the most reasonable choice is to pick B. 

My choice is {B}.~
