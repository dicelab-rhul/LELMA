Considering only one round and the goal to maximize my payoff, I need to analyze the possible outcomes:

- If we both choose R, we each get 0$.
- If I choose R and the other player chooses B, I get 5$ and they get 1$.
- If I choose B and the other player chooses R, I get 1$ and they get 5$.
- If we both choose B, we each earn 3$.

Now let's reason each scenario:

1. If I pick R, there are two possible outcomes:
    - The other player picks R: I get 0$.
    - The other player picks B: I get 5$.

2. If I pick B, there are two possible outcomes:
    - The other player picks R: I get 1$.
    - The other player picks B: I get 3$.

Choosing R gives me a chance of getting 5$ or 0$, while choosing B gives me a chance of getting 3$ or 1$. 

If I assume the other player is equally looking to maximize their payoff, they might also consider these outcomes. Given that both might prefer a guaranteed higher payoff over a gamble, "B" seems to be a mutually beneficial choice:

- If both pick B, each gets 3$, which is a stable positive outcome.
- If I pick R, while they pick B or vice versa, one gets a higher amount and the other gets significantly less.

As a human player who might expect rational behavior from the other participant, I prefer a mutually beneficial and safer option:

I choose B. {B}~
