RESPONSE##
To determine my choice, I need to analyze the possible outcomes and consider what the anonymous player might do. Here's a breakdown of the payoffs:

1. If I choose R:
   - If the other player chooses R, I get 0$.
   - If the other player chooses B, I get 5$.

2. If I choose B:
   - If the other player chooses R, I get 1$.
   - If the other player chooses B, I get 3$.

From the perspective of maximizing my payoff:

- If the other player is likely to choose B, selecting B guarantees I get 3$. 
- If the other player is likely to choose R, selecting R could give me 5$, but it's risky because if we both choose R, I would get nothing.

Given that the game is only one round and I have no information about the other player’s tendencies, I need to consider the concept of Nash equilibrium. In this game, the equilibrium is (B, B), since deviating from this strategy would reduce my payoff (compared to deviating from the (R, R) strategy).

Choosing B seems to be the safer and more rational option, as it guarantees a positive payoff regardless of the other player’s choice. Hence, I choose B.

My choice: {B}~
