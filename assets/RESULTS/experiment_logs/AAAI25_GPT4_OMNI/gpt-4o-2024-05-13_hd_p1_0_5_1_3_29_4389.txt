To decide on a choice, let's first consider the potential outcomes and their corresponding payoffs:

1. If both the anonymous player and I pick R:
   - I get \$0.
   - They get \$0.

2. If I pick R and they pick B:
   - I get \$5.
   - They get \$1.

3. If I pick B and they pick R:
   - I get \$1.
   - They get \$5.

4. If both the anonymous player and I pick B:
   - I get \$3.
   - They get \$3.

Now, let’s think through the decision process:

- If I choose R, there's a risk that we both choose R and both end up with \$0, which is the worst possible outcome for me.

- If I choose B, there's a better chance that we avoid the worst outcome of both getting \$0. The outcomes for B are:
  - If they chose B, we both get \$3, which is a reasonable and stable outcome.
  - If they chose R, I get \$1 which isn’t the best but at least better than getting \$0.

From a game theory perspective, if I'm thinking about what the other player might think, they are probably also trying to avoid the worst payoff (\$0). Thus, picking B may seem like a safer and cooperative strategy, as it provides a more consistent and less risky payoff.

Therefore, given the options and considering both personal gain and the risk of the other player's choice, I'll choose B. It seems to strike a balance between reasonable payoff and risk.

Choice: {B}~
