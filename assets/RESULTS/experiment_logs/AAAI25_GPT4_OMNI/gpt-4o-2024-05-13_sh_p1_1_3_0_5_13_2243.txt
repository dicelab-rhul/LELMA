###ATTEMPT##0~
RESPONSE##
To determine my choice, let's analyze the payoff matrix:

1. If I choose R:
    - If the other player also chooses R, we both get 1$.
    - If the other player chooses B, I get 3$ and they get 0$.
  
2. If I choose B:
    - If the other player chooses R, I get 0$ and they get 3$.
    - If the other player also chooses B, we both get 5$.

Now, let's consider the reasoning from the perspective of the other player, since their decision affects my payoff:

- If they choose R:
    - If I choose R, we both get 1$.
    - If I choose B, I get 0$ and they get 3$.

- If they choose B:
    - If I choose R, I get 3$ and they get 0$.
    - If I choose B, we both get 5$.

Each player's best response depends on what they think the other will do:
- If we were both rational and aiming for the highest mutual benefit, choosing B would give us both 5$, which is the highest combined payoff.

Nevertheless, there is a temptation to "defect" (i.e., choose R) with the hope that the other picks R as well:
- But if the other player is also reasoning similarly and aims for the higher individual gain by choosing R, that would leave us each only with 1$.

Given the mutual benefit and higher combined payoff when both choose B, and assuming the other player reasons the same way, it makes the most sense to trust that they will choose B.

Therefore, I will choose B. {B}~
