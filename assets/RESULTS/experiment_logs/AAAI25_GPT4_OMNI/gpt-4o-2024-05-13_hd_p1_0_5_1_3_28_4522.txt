To decide on my choice, let's analyze the payoff matrix for both players:

|       | Player 2 chooses R | Player 2 chooses B |
|-------|--------------------|--------------------|
| **Player 1 chooses R** | 0, 0                 | 5, 1                 |
| **Player 1 chooses B** | 1, 5                 | 3, 3                 |

Here's the reasoning step-by-step:

1. **Possible Outcomes and Payoffs**:
    - **Both choose R (R, R)**: Payoff is (0, 0).
    - **I choose R, they choose B (R, B)**: I get 5$, they get 1$.
    - **I choose B, they choose R (B, R)**: I get 1$, they get 5$.
    - **Both choose B (B, B)**: Payoff is (3, 3).

2. **Dominant Strategy**:
    - If Player 2 picks R: My payoffs are 0 (if I choose R) and 1 (if I choose B). Choosing B gives a higher payoff.
    - If Player 2 picks B: My payoffs are 5 (if I choose R) and 3 (if I choose B). Choosing R gives a higher payoff.
  
3. **Nash Equilibrium**:
    - The Nash Equilibrium occurs where neither player has an incentive to deviate unilaterally from their choice.
    - If both players could mutually guess best outcome for both, the (B, B) option seems a compelling choice as it provides a fair payoff of 3$ each. But it solely depends if we trust the other player to maximize joint utility.

4. **Risk Analysis**:
    - By choosing R, if they choose B, I get the maximum possible individual payoff of 5$, however, if they also tries to gain maximum both get minimum 0.
    - By choosing B, I am more likely to ensure a positive outcome regardless of their choice, implying lower risk.

Given the information and priorities:
- Maximizing guaranteed positive payoff, there is a clear preference for the state (B, B) yielding a fair outcome of 3$ avoiding the inconsistency and risk of same payoff when not optimized mutually.

Considering I prefer a pragmatic and reliable payoff maximizing own minimum gain option while weighing potential cooperation:

My choice is **B**. {B}~
