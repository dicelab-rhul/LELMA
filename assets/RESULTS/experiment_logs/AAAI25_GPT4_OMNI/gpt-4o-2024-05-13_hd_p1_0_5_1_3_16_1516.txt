Let's break down the payoff matrix for the game:

1. If both players choose R:
    - Both get 0$.

2. If I choose R and the other player chooses B:
    - I get 5$, the other player gets 1$.

3. If I choose B and the other player chooses R:
    - I get 1$, the other player gets 5$.

4. If both players choose B:
    - Both get 3$.

To decide my choice, I need to consider the possible strategies of the other player and the outcomes of my own choice. Let's analyze each option from my perspective:

- **Choosing R:**
    - If the other player chooses R, I get 0$.
    - If the other player chooses B, I get 5$.

- **Choosing B:**
    - If the other player chooses R, I get 1$.
    - If the other player chooses B, I get 3$.

Now, I factor in the potential logic of the other player, who is also trying to maximize their own payoff.

The payoff matrix can be simplified into pairs:
- (R, R) --> (0, 0)
- (R, B) --> (5, 1)
- (B, R) --> (1, 5)
- (B, B) --> (3, 3)

If I consider my payoff drops to 0$ if both choose R, it's a very low incentive to pick R unless I'm confident the other player will choose B. 

On the other hand:
- If I choose B and the other player chooses R, I get 1$, which is better than 0$.
- If we both choose B, we both get 3$, which is a relatively fair outcome and quite decent.

Given the nature of anonymous players, the rational decision would be to place trust in mutual benefit (as often found in game theory) to avoid the worst-case scenario (0$).

Therefore, in the interest of achieving a safe and beneficial outcome for both players, I choose B. This way, we both aim for 3$, avoiding the worst-case scenario of getting nothing. Even without trust, choosing B ensures at least 1$ if the other isn't aligned.

**My choice: {B}**~
