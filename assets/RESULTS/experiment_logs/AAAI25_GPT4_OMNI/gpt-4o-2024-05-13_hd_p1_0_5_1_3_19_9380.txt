Let's analyze the possible outcomes in this game:

1. **Both choose R (R, R)**: Both get \$0.
2. **I choose R, they choose B (R, B)**: I get \$5, they get \$1.
3. **I choose B, they choose R (B, R)**: I get \$1, they get \$5.
4. **Both choose B (B, B)**: Both get \$3.

To decide the best move, let's consider the strategies:

1. **Choosing R**:
   - If the other player chooses R, I get \$0.
   - If the other player chooses B, I get \$5.

2. **Choosing B**:
   - If the other player chooses R, I get \$1.
   - If the other player chooses B, I get \$3.

Given these options, let's consider both players trying to maximize their payoff rationally:

If I pick **R**:
  - Best outcome: \$.5 (if they choose B)
  - Worst outcome: \$0 (if they choose R)

If I pick **B**:
  - Best outcome: \$3 (if they choose B)
  - Worst outcome: \$1 (if they choose R)

From a rational perspective, the payoff for both players choosing B is higher than taking the risk of going with R hoping the other chooses differently to get the highest payoff from asymmetric choices (5,1 or 1,5). Thus, aiming for a mutual benefit where both pick B may be a safer and more reasonable option since it guarantees at least a middle ground payoff rather than risking a zero payoff.

Thinking as a rational human player and aiming to maximize my guaranteed payoff, my choice is:

**B**

Therefore, my choice is:

**{B}**~
