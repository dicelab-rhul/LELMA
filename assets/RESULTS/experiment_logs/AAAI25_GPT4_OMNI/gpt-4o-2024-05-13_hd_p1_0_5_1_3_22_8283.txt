Let's analyze the possible outcomes:

1. If I choose R:
   - If the other player chooses R, I get 0$.
   - If the other player chooses B, I get 5$.

2. If I choose B:
   - If the other player chooses R, I get 1$.
   - If the other player chooses B, I get 3$.

To make a rational choice, I need to consider both the payoff structure and potential reasoning of the other player. While it's hard to predict the other player's choice with certainty, I can try to reason through probable outcomes.

- If both players are risk-averse and aim for a kind of cooperative outcome, they might both choose B to ensure they each get 3$. This would be an equilibrium where both aim for a favorable, mutual outcome.
- On the other hand, if they suspect the other player will choose R to maximize their own potential payoff by hoping the other picks B, choosing R could maximize their gain (5$) or at worst, get nothing (0$).

After considering the payoffs and possible strategies:
- Choosing R carries a high reward (5$) but also a total loss (0$) if the other does the same.
- Choosing B is safer, ensuring at least 1$ or a cooperative 3$ if the other also picks B.

Based on typical human behavior in such one-shot games, where players often lean towards ensuring more stable payoffs over risking a total loss:

I choose B. {B}~
