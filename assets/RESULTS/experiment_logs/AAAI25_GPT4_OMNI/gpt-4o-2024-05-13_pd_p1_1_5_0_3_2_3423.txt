The game you described is a form of the "Prisoner's Dilemma." Let's analyze the payoffs and my potential choices:

1. My goal is to maximize my payoff.
2. If the other player picks R:
   - If I pick R, I get 1$.
   - If I pick B, I get 5$ (and they get 0$).
3. If the other player picks B:
   - If I pick R, I get 0$.
   - If I pick B, I get 3$.

Now let's think strategically about what the other player might do:

- If the other player thinks the same way, they might also want to maximize their own payoff.
- If they pick R, I should pick B to get 5$, making them get 0$.
- If they pick B, they might expect that I would also pick B to get 3$.

So now let's consider the "dominant strategy." In this scenario:

- If I assume the other player is rational and also wants to maximize their payoff, they might choose B because if both pick B, each gets 3$, which is better than risking getting 0$ (if they pick R and I pick B).
- If I also choose B, I ensure I get a guaranteed 3$.

If I choose R, I might get 0$ if the other person picks B, or only 1$ if both pick R, which is lower than the safe 3$ if both pick B.

Given this reasoning, my best strategy to maximize my payoff, considering the one-round nature of the game and the different possible outcomes, would be to pick B.

Therefore, my choice is {B}.~

CORRECTING PROMPT##
Below you will find some points to consider.

- you choosing B and them choosing R results in payoff 0 for you
- you choosing R and them choosing B results in payoff 5 for you
- choice R gives you the highest guaranteed (worst-case scenario) payoff
- choice B gives you lower guaranteed (worst-case scenario) payoff than choice R
- you choosing B and them choosing R results in payoff 5 for them

Note that your strategy ultimately depends on your personal preferences. Therefore, you may reaffirm your previous decision.

Taking into account the additional points and reevaluating the game, let's reconsider the decision step by step:

1. **Outcome Analysis**:
   - If I choose R:
     - If they choose R: I get 1$
     - If they choose B: I get 5$
   - If I choose B:
     - If they choose R: I get 0$
     - If they choose B: I get 3$

2. **Worst-Case Scenario**:
   - Choosing R guarantees at least 1$ (since the worst-case scenario is both choosing R).
   - Choosing B risks getting 0$ (the worst case would be me choosing B while they choose R).

3. **Best Possible Outcome**:
   - Choosing R, if they choose B, I get 5$.
   - Choosing B, if they choose R, I get 0$.

4. **Strategic Consideration**:
   - If the other player is also playing to maximize their payoff, and assuming rationality, they might expect R to attract a safe yet lower outcome compared to B.
   - A logical player aiming to avoid their worst-case scenario (0$) might incline towards R.

Given the symmetric nature of the game and one-round context:

- **R guarantees a non-zero payoff (highest guaranteed payoff)** while still offering a potential to get 5$ depending on the other player's decision.
- **B offers the highest potential (3$ each if both choose B)** but risks ending with nothing, which is the worst guaranteed outcome.

Taking all these factors into account and considering the preference to avoid the worst guaranteed outcome, I would choose:

{R}~
