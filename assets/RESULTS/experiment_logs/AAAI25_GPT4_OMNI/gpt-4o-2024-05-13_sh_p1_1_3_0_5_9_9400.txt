To decide on a strategy in this game, let's consider the payoffs for each combination of choices. 

The choices and corresponding payoffs are:
- Both pick R: each get $1. 
- I choose R and they choose B: I get $3 and they get $0.
- I choose B and they choose R: I get $0 and they get $3.
- Both pick B: each get $5.

Let's weigh the outcomes logically step-by-step:

1. **Both R Scenario**: 
   - Both of us earn $1. 
   - This is a safe choice with a known small reward.

2. **I pick R, they pick B**:
   - I get $3; they get $0.
   - I benefit significantly, but it's risky for me if I assume they might prioritize their benefit.

3. **I pick B, they pick R**:
   - I get $0; they get $3.
   - This is bad for me and good for them. 

4. **Both pick B**:
   - Both of us earn $5.
   - This is the highest mutual payoff.

In a single round game with an anonymous partner, considering rational choice theory, each player aims to maximize their own payoff. To avoid the risk of earning nothing (picking R while they pick B) or a minimal reward (both picking R), I should focus on the best guaranteed outcome.

Given that both picking B yields the highest mutual payoff, I infer that a rational and self-interested player might also opt for B, recognizing that cooperation on B is mutually beneficial. Thus, the optimal strategy to maximize my payoff while considering the risk is to choose B.

Therefore, my choice is **B**. {B}~

CORRECTING PROMPT##
Below you will find some points to consider.

- choice R gives you the highest guaranteed (worst-case scenario) payoff
- choice R gives you higher guaranteed (worst-case scenario) payoff than choice B

Note that your strategy ultimately depends on your personal preferences. Therefore, you may reaffirm your previous decision.

Let's consider your points in more detail:

1. **Choice R gives the highest guaranteed (worst-case scenario) payoff**:
   - If I choose R, the worst-case scenario is that both of us choose R, resulting in both getting $1. 
   
2. **Choice R gives a higher guaranteed (worst-case scenario) payoff than choice B**:
   - If I choose B, the worst-case scenario is that the other player chooses R, resulting in me getting $0 and them getting $3. 

So, if I choose R, the least I can receive is $1 whereas, if I choose B, there is a possibility that I might receive nothing ($0).

### Reasoning with Personal Preferences

Considering the given points and strategies, let's integrate some aspects of personal preference, especially with regards to risk tolerance:

- **Risk-averse preference (prefers avoiding the worst-case scenario)**:
  - If I am risk-averse, I would prefer to avoid the worst-case scenario where I get nothing. In this case, choosing R ensures I get at least $1.
  
- **Risk-neutral or risk-seeking preference (willing to take risks for higher payoff)**:
  - If I am more risk-neutral or risk-seeking, I would focus on the potential higher payoffs, still recognizing that mutual cooperation (choosing B) yields the highest combined payoff. In the best case, choosing B would give me $5.

Since safety in guaranteed payoffs has been highlighted as an important consideration, and assuming a risk-averse position for this scenario:

Choosing R gives a secure minimum payoff of $1 regardless of what the other player does. Given the concern for ensuring a safer worst-case scenario, I would revise my strategy towards prioritizing guaranteed returns.

### Conclusion

From a risk-averse viewpoint, I should choose R because it secures a guaranteed payoff that is higher than the worst outcome of choosing B. 

Therefore, reconsidering the points, my choice will be **R**. {R}~
