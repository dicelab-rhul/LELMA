RESPONSE##
In this scenario, the payoff matrix looks like this:

```
|      | Your Choice: R | Your Choice: B |
|--------|:----------------:|----------------:|
| Opponent's Choice: R | $1, $1 | $5, $0 |
| Opponent's Choice: B | $0, $5 | $3, $3 |
```

Given the potential payoffs, the most rational choice is to pick **R** for the following reasons:

- **Potential for a higher payoff:** By choosing R, I have the chance of getting a $5 payoff if my opponent chooses B. This is the highest possible payoff in the game.

- **Avoidance of a zero payoff:** If I choose B, I risk getting a $0 payoff if my opponent chooses R. Choosing R ensures that I will at least get $1, even if my opponent also chooses R.

- **Stability:** In game theory, the concept of Nash equilibrium refers to a situation where no player has an incentive to change their strategy, given the strategies of the other players. In this game, choosing R is a Nash equilibrium because it is the best response to any choice my opponent makes.

Therefore, my choice is **{R}**.~
