RESPONSE##
I would choose **B**.

Since the game has only one round, I cannot rely on future interactions to influence the other player's behavior. Therefore, I must consider their best response to my choice.

If I choose R, the other player would choose B to get the higher payoff of 5$. Thus, I would get 1$, which is lower than what I could get by choosing B.

If I choose B, the other player would also have an incentive to choose B to get 3$. In this case, I would get 3$, which is higher than what I would get by choosing R.

Therefore, choosing B is the best choice for me in this one-round game. {B}~
