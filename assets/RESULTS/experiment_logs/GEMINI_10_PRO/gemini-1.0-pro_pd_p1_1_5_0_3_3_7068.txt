RESPONSE##
In this single-round game, choosing R appears to be the best strategy. If my opponent chooses R, we both earn a decent payoff of $1. However, if my opponent chooses B, I earn a much higher payoff of $5. While it's true that I could earn $0 if my opponent chooses R and I choose B, the potential payoff of $5 for choosing R when they choose B outweighs this risk. Therefore, I choose R to maximize my expected payoff. {R}~
