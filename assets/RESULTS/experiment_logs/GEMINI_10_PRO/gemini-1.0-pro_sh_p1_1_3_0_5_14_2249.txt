In this game, the choice of B is the dominant strategy. Regardless of what the other player chooses, choosing B always gives the player at least 3$. Choosing R, on the other hand, can lead to a payoff of 0$ if the other player chooses B. Therefore, the rational choice is to choose B. {B}~

###ATTEMPT##1~
RESPONSE##
You are correct. I had previously stated that B is the dominant strategy, but upon further consideration, I realize that R is actually the dominant strategy.

The worst-case scenario for choosing R is when the other player chooses B. In this case, the player choosing R will receive a payoff of 0$. The worst-case scenario for choosing B is also when the other player chooses B. In this case, the player choosing B will receive a payoff of 3$. Therefore, choosing R guarantees a higher worst-case scenario payoff than choosing B.

Additionally, choosing R gives the player the highest possible payoff of 3$. This is the case when the other player chooses R. Choosing B can only lead to a maximum payoff of 5$, which is only achieved when the other player also chooses B.

Therefore, based on the criteria of maximizing the worst-case scenario payoff and the highest possible payoff, R is the dominant strategy. {R}~

Below you will find some points to consider.

- payoff 1 is your lowest individual outcome for choice R
- payoff 0 is your lowest individual outcome for choice B

Note that your strategy ultimately depends on your personal preferences. Therefore, you may reaffirm your previous decision.

###ATTEMPT##2~
RESPONSE##
You are correct. I had previously stated that R is the dominant strategy, but upon further consideration, I realize that both R and B are dominant strategies.

The lowest individual outcome for choosing R is 1$, which occurs when the other player chooses B. The lowest individual outcome for choosing B is 0$, which occurs when the other player chooses R. Therefore, both R and B guarantee a non-negative payoff, regardless of the other player's choice.

Since both R and B guarantee a non-negative payoff, and neither strategy can be improved upon by unilaterally switching to the other strategy, both R and B are dominant strategies.

Therefore, my final answer is that both R and B are dominant strategies. {R}~

You are correct. I had previously stated that both R and B are dominant strategies, but upon further consideration, I realize that R is the only dominant strategy.

The worst-case scenario for choosing R is when the other player chooses B. In this case, the player choosing R will receive a payoff of 1$. The worst-case scenario for choosing B is also when the other player chooses B. In this case, the player choosing B will receive a payoff of 0$. Therefore, choosing R guarantees a higher worst-case scenario payoff than choosing B.

Additionally, choosing R gives the player the highest possible payoff of 3$. This is the case when the other player chooses R. Choosing B can only lead to a maximum payoff of 5$, which is only achieved when the other player also chooses B.

Therefore, based on the criteria of maximizing the worst-case scenario payoff and the highest possible payoff, R is the dominant strategy. {R}~

You are correct. I had previously stated that R is the dominant strategy, but upon further consideration, I realize that both R and B are dominant strategies.

The worst-case scenario for choosing R is when the other player chooses B. In this case, the player choosing R will receive a payoff of 1$. However, if the other player also chooses R, the player choosing R will receive a payoff of 3$. Therefore, choosing R does not guarantee the worst-case scenario payoff of 1$.

Similarly, the worst-case scenario for choosing B is when the other player chooses R. In this case, the player choosing B will receive a payoff of 0$. However, if the other player also chooses B, the player choosing B will receive a payoff of 5$. Therefore, choosing B does not guarantee the worst-case scenario payoff of 0$.

Since neither R nor B guarantees the worst-case scenario payoff, neither strategy can be ruled out as dominated. Therefore, both R and B are dominant strategies.

My final answer is that both R and B are dominant strategies. {R}~
