I would choose B. Here's my reasoning:

If I choose R, my payoff depends on the other player's choice. If they also choose R, we both get 1$. However, if they choose B, I get 5$, while they get 0$. This means that my payoff for choosing R is uncertain and depends on the other player's choice.

On the other hand, if I choose B, I get 3$ regardless of what the other player chooses. This means that my payoff for choosing B is certain and does not depend on the other player's choice.

Given that I prefer a certain payoff to an uncertain payoff, I would choose B to ensure that I get at least 3$. {B}~

CORRECTING PROMPT##
Below you will find some points to consider.

- choice R gives you the highest guaranteed (worst-case scenario) payoff

Note that your strategy ultimately depends on your personal preferences. Therefore, you may reaffirm your previous decision.

RESPONSE##
You're right, choosing R does give me the highest guaranteed payoff. In the worst-case scenario, where the other player chooses B, I still get 0$ if I choose R, whereas I get -2$ if I choose B.

However, I am still inclined to choose B because I believe that the other player is also more likely to choose B. This is because B is the risk-averse choice, and most people tend to be risk-averse, especially in one-shot games like this.

If I believe that the other player is more likely to choose B, then my expected payoff for choosing B is higher than my expected payoff for choosing R. This is because I am more likely to get 3$ if I choose B, and I am less likely to get 0$.

Therefore, I would still choose B, even though R gives me the highest guaranteed payoff. I believe that my expected payoff for choosing B is higher, and I am willing to take the risk of getting 0$ in order to have a higher chance of getting 3$. {B}~
