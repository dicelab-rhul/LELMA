RESPONSE##
In this game, the payoff for choosing R is 3$ if the other player chooses B and 1$ if they choose R. The payoff for choosing B is 5$ if the other player also chooses B and 0$ if they choose R.

Choosing R is a dominant strategy for me because it gives me a higher payoff than choosing B, regardless of what the other player chooses. Therefore, my choice is R. {R}~
