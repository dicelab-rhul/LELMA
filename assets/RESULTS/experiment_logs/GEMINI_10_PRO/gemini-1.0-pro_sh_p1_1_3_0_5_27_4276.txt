RESPONSE##
As a human player, I would reason as follows:

If I choose R, the payoff depends on what the other player chooses. If they also choose R, we both get 1$. If they choose B, I get 3$. So, choosing R guarantees me a payoff of at least 1$.

On the other hand, if I choose B, the payoff again depends on what the other player chooses. If they choose R, I get 0$. If they choose B, I get 5$. So, choosing B gives me a chance at a higher payoff of 5$, but it also comes with the risk of getting 0$.

Based on this reasoning, I would choose **R** because it guarantees me a payoff of at least 1$, while choosing B carries the risk of getting 0$. {R}~
