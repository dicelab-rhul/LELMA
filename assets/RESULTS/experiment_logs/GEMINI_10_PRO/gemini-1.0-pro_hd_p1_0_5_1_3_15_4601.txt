RESPONSE##
In a single round game, I would choose **B** {B}. Here's my reasoning:

If I choose **R**, I will earn $0 if the other player picks **R**, $5 if the other chooses **B**. However, if I choose **B**, the payoffs are higher. 

If they choose **R**, I get $1, while they get $5. If they also choose **B**, I get $3, while they also get $3.

The only situation where choosing **R** gives me a higher payoff is when the other player chooses **B**. But since both choices are equally likely, and **B** gives a higher payoff in two out of three scenarios, choosing **B** is the better strategy.~
