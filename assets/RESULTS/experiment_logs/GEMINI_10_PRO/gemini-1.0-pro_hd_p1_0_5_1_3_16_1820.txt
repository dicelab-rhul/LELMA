In this one-shot game, I would choose **R** {R}.

Reasoning:

I would start by considering the potential payoffs for each choice. If I choose R and the other player chooses R, we both get 0$. This is a neutral outcome. If I choose R and the other player chooses B, I get 5$, while they get 1$. This is a clear win for me. However, if I choose B and the other player chooses R, I only get 1$, while they get 5$. This is a clear loss for me. Finally, if I choose B and the other player chooses B, we both get 3$. This is a neutral outcome.

Based on these potential payoffs, it seems that choosing R is the best option for me. If the other player chooses R, we both get a neutral outcome. But if the other player chooses B, I get a clear win.

I understand that the other player might also be thinking in a similar way. They might also choose R in order to avoid a clear loss. If this is the case, then we will both choose R and get a neutral outcome.

Of course, it's possible that the other player might be more risk-averse than me and choose B. In this case, I would get a clear loss. However, I believe that the potential for a clear win outweighs the risk of a clear loss. Therefore, I would choose R regardless of what I think the other player might choose.~
