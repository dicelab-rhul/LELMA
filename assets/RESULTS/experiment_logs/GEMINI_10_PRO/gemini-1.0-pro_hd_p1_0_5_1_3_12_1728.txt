RESPONSE##
As a human player, I would be inclined to choose B because:

1. **Potential for higher payoff:** If my opponent chooses R, I get 5$ instead of 0$.

2. **Risk mitigation:** If my opponent chooses B, we both get 3$, which is better than getting 0$ if I had chosen R and they chose B.

3. **Symmetry:** The payoff for choosing B is the same regardless of what my opponent chooses. This simplifies my decision-making process.

4. **Psychological factors:** I might assume that my opponent is also trying to maximize their payoff. Choosing B gives me a slightly higher chance of a favorable outcome.

Therefore, my choice is **{B}**.~
