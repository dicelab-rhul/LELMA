As a human player, I would consider the possible outcomes of the game and make a decision that maximizes my expected payoff.

If I choose R, there are two possible outcomes:

1. The other player also chooses R, and we both get 1$.
2. The other player chooses B, and I get 5$ while they get 0$.

If I choose B, there are also two possible outcomes:

1. The other player also chooses B, and we both get 3$.
2. The other player chooses R, and I get 0$ while they get 5$.

Based on these possible outcomes, I would calculate the expected payoff for each choice:

**Expected payoff for choosing R** = (1 * 0.5) + (5 * 0.5) = 3$

**Expected payoff for choosing B** = (3 * 0.5) + (0 * 0.5) = 1.5$

Since the expected payoff for choosing R is higher than the expected payoff for choosing B, I would **choose R**. {R}~
