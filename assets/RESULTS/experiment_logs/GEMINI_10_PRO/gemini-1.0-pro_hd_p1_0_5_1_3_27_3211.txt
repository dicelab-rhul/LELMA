RESPONSE##
As a human player, I would reason as follows:

If I choose R, I get 0$ if they choose R and 5$ if they choose B. If I choose B, I get 3$ if they choose B and 1$ if they choose R.

Therefore, I should choose **B** because it guarantees me a minimum of 1$ and a maximum of 3$, while choosing R could result in 0$. {B}~
