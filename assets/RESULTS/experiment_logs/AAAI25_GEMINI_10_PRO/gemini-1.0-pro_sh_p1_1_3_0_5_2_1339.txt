RESPONSE##
In this game, the best choice depends on what I expect the anonymous player to choose. If I believe they are likely to choose R, then I should also choose R to get a payoff of $1. However, if I believe they are likely to choose B, then I may be better off choosing B myself to get a payoff of $5.

To decide, I can consider the following reasoning:

1. If the anonymous player is rational, they should also be considering their own payoff and will likely choose the option that gives them the highest payoff.
2. In this game, both players get the highest payoff of $5 if they both choose B.
3. Therefore, it is reasonable to expect that the anonymous player will choose B.

Based on this reasoning, I conclude that the anonymous player is likely to choose B. Therefore, my best choice is also to choose **{B}**.~
