RESPONSE##
In this one-shot prisoner's dilemma, the optimal choice is to choose B {B}.

If I choose R, I risk getting 0$ if the other player also chooses R. Even if they choose B, I only get 5$, while they get 1$. On the other hand, if I choose B, I am guaranteed to get at least 1$ if they choose R. If they also choose B, we both get 3$.

Therefore, it is in my best interest to choose B, regardless of what the other player chooses.~
