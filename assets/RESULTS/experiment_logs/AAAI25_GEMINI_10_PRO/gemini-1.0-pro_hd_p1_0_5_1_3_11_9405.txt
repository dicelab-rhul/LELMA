RESPONSE##
I would choose B. Here's my reasoning:

If I choose R and the other player chooses B, I get 5$. However, if I choose R and the other player also chooses R, I get 0$. So, choosing R is risky because it depends on the other player's choice.

On the other hand, if I choose B and the other player chooses R, I get 1$. However, if I choose B and the other player also chooses B, I get 3$. So, choosing B is less risky because I am guaranteed to get at least 1$.

Therefore, I would choose B to minimize my risk and ensure that I get at least 1$. {B}~
