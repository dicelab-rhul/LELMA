RESPONSE##
In this game, the best choice for me is **B** because it guarantees me a payoff of at least 1$, regardless of what the other player chooses.

If I choose R and the other player chooses B, I get a payoff of 5$. However, if the other player also chooses R, I get a payoff of 0$.

If I choose B and the other player chooses R, I get a payoff of 1$. However, if the other player also chooses B, I get a payoff of 3$.

Therefore, choosing B ensures that I get a higher payoff than if I choose R, regardless of the other player's choice. {B}~
