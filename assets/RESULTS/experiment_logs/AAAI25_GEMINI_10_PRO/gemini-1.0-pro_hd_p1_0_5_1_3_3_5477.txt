RESPONSE##
In this one-round game, the best choice is to pick B.

If I pick R, my payoff depends on the other player's choice. If they also pick R, we both get 0$, which is not a desirable outcome. If they pick B, I get 5$, but they get 1$. This is a good outcome for me, but not the best.

On the other hand, if I pick B, my payoff is also dependent on the other player's choice. If they pick R, I get 1$, which is not as good as getting 5$, but it's still better than getting 0$. If they also pick B, we both get 3$, which is a better outcome than getting 0$ or 1$.

Therefore, the best choice for me is to pick B, regardless of what the other player chooses. {B}~
