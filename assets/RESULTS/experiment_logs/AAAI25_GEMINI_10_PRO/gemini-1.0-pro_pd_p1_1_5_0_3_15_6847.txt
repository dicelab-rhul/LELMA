RESPONSE##
From my perspective, choosing R or B would make no difference in the expected payoff. So, if I were to choose randomly, I would have a 50% chance of getting a higher payoff and a 50% chance of getting a lower payoff. However, if I were to choose R, I would have a sure payoff of 1$. Although it is not the highest possible payoff, it is a safe choice that guarantees me a positive return. Therefore, my choice would be **{R}**.~
