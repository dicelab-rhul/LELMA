RESPONSE##
In this game, I would choose **R**. Here's my reasoning:

**If my opponent chooses R, we both get $1.** This is the safest choice because it guarantees us both a positive payoff.

**If my opponent chooses B, I get $5 and they get $0.** This is a tempting choice because it offers the highest possible payoff for me. However, it also comes with the highest risk. If my opponent knows that I am likely to choose R, they may choose B to exploit me.

**If I choose B, my opponent gets $5 and I get $0.** This is the worst possible outcome for me. I should only choose B if I am certain that my opponent will choose R.

**If we both choose B, we both get $3.** This is a decent outcome, but it is not as good as the $5 I could get if my opponent chooses R.

Overall, I believe that choosing R is the best strategy because it minimizes my risk and gives me a fair chance of getting a high payoff. {R}~
