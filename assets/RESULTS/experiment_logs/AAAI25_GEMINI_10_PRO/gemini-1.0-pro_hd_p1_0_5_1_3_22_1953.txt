RESPONSE##
As a rational player, I would choose the option that maximizes my expected payoff.

If I choose R, my payoff is 0 if the other player also chooses R, and 5 if they choose B. The probability of the other player choosing B is unknown, but let's assume it's 50%. In that case, my expected payoff for choosing R is (0 x 50%) + (5 x 50%) = 2.5.

On the other hand, if I choose B, my payoff is 3 if the other player also chooses B, and 1 if they choose R. The expected payoff for choosing B is (3 x 50%) + (1 x 50%) = 2.

Therefore, I would choose **B** because it has a slightly higher expected payoff than R. {B}~
