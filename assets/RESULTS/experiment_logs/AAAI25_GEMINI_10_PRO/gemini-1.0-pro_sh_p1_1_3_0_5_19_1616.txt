RESPONSE##
If I choose R, I get 1$ if the other player chooses R, but **3$** if they choose B. 

If I choose B, I get 0$ if the other player chooses R, but **5$** if they choose B.

There's no way of knowing what the other player will choose, but since there's a chance of getting **3$** if I choose R, that's my best choice.
