RESPONSE##
In this one-shot game, the best choice for me is to pick **B** because it guarantees me a payoff of at least 1$ regardless of what the other player chooses.

If the other player also picks B, we both get 3$, which is a better outcome than getting 0$.

If the other player picks R, I get 1$, which is still better than getting 0$ if I had picked R myself.

Therefore, choosing B is the rational choice in this game. {B}~
