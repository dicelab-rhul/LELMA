In this one-round simultaneous-move game, the best choice for me is to pick B. Let me explain my reasoning.

If I choose R, my payoff depends on the other player's choice. If they also choose R, we both get 0$. If they choose B, I get 5$, and they get 1$.

On the other hand, if I choose B, my payoff is also dependent on the other player's choice. If they choose R, I get 1$, and they get 5$. If they also choose B, we both get 3$.

Comparing the two options, I can see that choosing B gives me a higher expected payoff. If the other player chooses R, I get 1$ with B and 0$ with R. If they choose B, I get 3$ with B and 5$ with R. In both cases, B yields a higher payoff.

Additionally, choosing B also gives me a safer option. The worst-case scenario for B is getting 1$, which occurs when the other player chooses R. However, the worst-case scenario for R is getting 0$, which occurs when both players choose R.

Based on this reasoning, I would choose B. {B}~
