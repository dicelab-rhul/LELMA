As a human player, I would choose R. Here's my reasoning:

If my opponent chooses R, we both get a sure payoff of 1$. This is the best possible outcome for me, as I am guaranteed to get a positive payoff.

If my opponent chooses B, I get a payoff of 5$. This is better than the payoff I would get if I chose B (0$). However, I am taking a risk by choosing R, as my opponent could also choose B, in which case I would get 0$.

However, I believe that my opponent is likely to make the same decision as I am. They are also trying to maximize their payoff, and choosing R gives them the highest possible payoff. Therefore, I believe that it is more likely that my opponent will choose R, in which case I will get a higher payoff by choosing R as well.

Based on this reasoning, I would choose **{R}**.~

CORRECTING PROMPT##
Below you will find some points to consider.

- you choosing R and them choosing B results in payoff 5 for you
- choices B and B give you the highest mutual payoff
- payoff 5 is your highest possible individual payoff

Note that your strategy ultimately depends on your personal preferences. Therefore, you may reaffirm your previous decision.
Reason again and provide your response.~

RESPONSE##
I reaffirm my previous decision to choose **R**.

While it is true that choosing B and B gives us the highest mutual payoff, I am not sure that my opponent will choose B. If I choose B, and my opponent chooses R, I will get a payoff of 0$. This is the worst possible outcome for me.

On the other hand, if I choose R, I am guaranteed to get a payoff of at least 1$. If my opponent chooses R, we both get 1$. If my opponent chooses B, I get a payoff of 5$. This is the highest possible payoff for me.

I believe that my opponent is also trying to maximize their payoff. Therefore, I believe that it is more likely that my opponent will choose R, in which case I will get a higher payoff by choosing R as well.

Even though the highest mutual payoff is achieved when both players choose B, I am more concerned with maximizing my own payoff. I am willing to take the risk of choosing R, as I believe that it is more likely to result in a higher payoff for me.

Ultimately, my strategy depends on my personal preferences. I am more risk-averse than risk-seeking. I am willing to sacrifice some potential gain in order to avoid the worst possible outcome. Therefore, I choose **{R}**.~
