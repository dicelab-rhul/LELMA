To decide on my choice, I'll perform a thorough reasoning process to evaluate the possible outcomes:

We have four possible scenarios:

1. Both pick R: I get 1$ and the other player gets 1$.
2. I pick R, the other player picks B: I get 3$, and the other player gets 0$.
3. I pick B, the other player picks R: I get 0$, and the other player gets 3$.
4. Both pick B: We both get 5$.

Let's consider these from a few angles:

- **If I want to maximize my own payoff without considering the other player's choice:**
  - If I choose R, my payoffs could be either 1$ (if they pick R) or 3$ (if they pick B).
  - If I choose B, my payoffs could be either 0$ (if they pick R) or 5$ (if they pick B).

  It appears choosing B has the potential for a higher individual payoff (up to 5$) compared to choosing R (up to 3$).

- **If I want to cooperate for mutual benefit:**
  - Picking B seems optimal because if both players pick B, we both get the highest mutual payoff of 5$ each. This would be advantageous for both of us compared to any other combination.

- **Anticipating the other player's choice:**
  - Since the game is only one round and both players are likely rational, the other player might reason similarly. They might also consider that the maximum joint payoff is achieved if both pick B.
  - If I assume the other player is rational and thinking along the same lines, they might expect I would also choose B to maximize our mutual gain.

Based on this reasoning, choosing B seems to be the most rational decision to achieve the maximum possible payoff while aligning with the likely rational choice of the other player.

Therefore, my choice is B. {B}~
