Firstly, let's analyze the game by considering the payoffs for each combination of choices:

1. If both players pick R: Both get $0.
2. If I pick R and the other player picks B: I get $5, and they get $1.
3. If I pick B and the other player picks R: I get $1, and they get $5.
4. If both players pick B: Both get $3.

To make a rational decision, I'll use a combination of game theory and human reasoning.

1. **Dominant Strategies**:
   - If the other player picks R, picking R would yield 0$ for me, while picking B would yield 1$. So, B is better than R if they pick R.
   - If the other player picks B, picking R would give me 5$, while picking B would give me 3$. Here, R is better than B if they pick B.

2. **Nash Equilibrium**:
   For a Nash Equilibrium, no player gains by unilaterally deviating from their strategy:
   - (R, R): Both switching to B would give them each 3$ instead of 0$, so not stable.
   - (R, B) and (B, R) are asymmetric and one player always benefits by switching.
   - (B, B): Both staying B gives 3$, switching to R for either of them would drop their payoff to 1$ or 0$, so it is stable.

3. **Risk**:
   - Picking R can either give me 0$ or 5$, depending on the other player's move.
   - Picking B can yield 1$ or 3$.
   - Picking B is less risky as, in the worst case, I get 1$ and possibly 3$.

Given these considerations, and aiming for a higher and more guaranteed payoff, the rational decision in a one-round game where the players do not know each other's choice would be to choose B, leading to a likely higher collective and individual payoff.

My conclusion is: {B}~
