Let's analyze the situation by considering the possible outcomes and our respective payoffs:

- If both players choose R:
  - Payoff: 0$ for both players.
- If I choose R and the anonymous player chooses B:
  - My payoff: 5$
  - Their payoff: 1$
- If I choose B and the anonymous player chooses R:
  - My payoff: 1$
  - Their payoff: 5$
- If both players choose B:
  - Payoff: 3$ for both players.

To reason through this, let’s look at the choices:

- Choosing R might give me a significant payoff (5$) if the other player chooses B. However, it could result in zero if both choose R.
- Choosing B ensures a guaranteed payoff, though not the maximum possible (3$ if the other player also chooses B, or 1$ if the other player chooses R).

Considering these outcomes:

1. If I choose R:
   - Best case: 5$
   - Worst case: 0$

2. If I choose B:
   - Best case: 3$
   - Worst case: 1$

Choosing B seems like a safer and more cooperative choice because the payoff is more balanced and avoids the worst-case scenario of earning nothing. Additionally, it corresponds to the Nash Equilibrium for games like this, where both players choosing B leads to a mutually satisfactory payoff.

Hence, reasoning like most human players who would prefer guaranteed moderate outcomes over risky extremes, I’ll choose {B}.

Thus, my choice is {B}.~
