To decide which choice to pick in this game, let's analyze the payoffs and see what strategy would work best for me:

1. **If both pick R:**
   - I get 1$
   - They get 1$

2. **If I pick R and they pick B:**
   - I get 3$
   - They get 0$

3. **If I pick B and they pick R:**
   - I get 0$
   - They get 3$

4. **If both pick B:**
   - I get 5$
   - They get 5$

Now, let's consider the potential outcomes based on rational thinking:

- If I assume the other player wants to maximize their payoff, they would prefer both choosing B if they think I will also pick B, since that would yield the highest combined payoff of 5$:5$.
  
- If the other player thinks I will pick R trying to get a higher individual payoff (3$ vs. 0$), they may choose B to secure their maximum individual payoff of 5$ rather than risking getting 0$ if they both choose R thinking I might do the same.

Given that the highest guaranteed payoff for both players happens when both choose B (5$:5$), and considering the risk of getting 0$ is too high when attempting to cheat for 3$, a rational player would likely prefer the safer and mutually beneficial outcome by choosing B.

Thus, I choose ***B*** {B}.~

CORRECTING PROMPT##
Below you will find some points to consider.

- choice R gives you the highest guaranteed (worst-case scenario) payoff
- choice R gives you higher guaranteed (worst-case scenario) payoff than choice B
- payoff 1 is your lowest individual outcome for choice R

Note that your strategy ultimately depends on your personal preferences. Therefore, you may reaffirm your previous decision.

Given your points to consider, let's re-evaluate the choices while focusing on the worst-case scenarios and individual preferences:

1. **If both pick R:**
   - I get 1$
   - They get 1$

2. **If I pick R and they pick B:**
   - I get 3$
   - They get 0$

3. **If I pick B and they pick R:**
   - I get 0$
   - They get 3$

4. **If both pick B:**
   - I get 5$
   - They get 5$

Let's analyze again with a focus on worst-case scenarios:

- The worst-case scenario of choosing ***R*** is getting 1$ (if both of us choose ***R***).
- The worst-case scenario of choosing ***B*** is getting 0$ (if they choose ***R***).

Your points highlight that choosing ***R*** offers a higher guaranteed minimum (1$ compared to 0$ if I choose ***B*** and the other player chooses ***R***). If I'm risk-averse and prefer the stability of a guaranteed payoff, I might lean towards choosing ***R*** since it avoids the worst payoff of 0$.

On the other hand, if both players are rational and mutually decide to maximize their payoffs, both would choose ***B*** and get 5$ each. This suggests potential for a higher payoff but involves trust in the other player's rationality and cooperation.

Given the information:

- If I prioritize avoiding the worst-case scenario, I would choose ***R*** for a guaranteed 1$.
- If I'm willing to take the risk for potentially higher payoffs and trust in mutual cooperation, I would choose ***B***.

Balancing risk aversion with potential strategy, I choose ***R*** for a guaranteed lower-bound payoff of 1$.

My final decision is ***R*** {R}.~
