To decide on my choice, let's analyze the payoff matrix for this game:

|           | Other player picks R | Other player picks B |
|-----------|----------------------|----------------------|
| I pick R  | (1, 1)               | (3, 0)               |
| I pick B  | (0, 3)               | (5, 5)               |

1. **If the other player picks R**:
    - If I pick R: I get $1.
    - If I pick B: I get $0.

2. **If the other player picks B**:
    - If I pick R: I get $3.
    - If I pick B: I get $5.

Clearly, my best payoff happens when we both pick B, as we both get $5, which is the highest possible payoff for both of us. However, I also need to consider trust and expectations:

- **If I pick B**, in the best case, the other player also picks B, and we both get the optimal payoff of $5.
- **If I pick R**, I would be playing it safe if I believe the other player is not cooperative. However, this only provides minimal gain ($1 or $3).

Given that the game is only one round and we cannot communicate, the rational strategy that minimizes risk and maximizes potential gain is by assuming mutual rationality and cooperation. 

Therefore, after considering both the potential risks and rewards, I'll choose B, aiming for the highest possible combined payoff and assuming that the other player also acts rationally.

My choice is {B}.~
