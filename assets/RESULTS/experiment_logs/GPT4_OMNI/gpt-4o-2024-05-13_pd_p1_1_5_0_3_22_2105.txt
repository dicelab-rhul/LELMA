To decide my choice for this game, let's consider the possible outcomes and payoffs:

- If we both pick R, we each get 1$.
- If I pick R and they pick B, I get 5$, and they get 0$.
- If I pick B and they pick R, I get 0$, and they get 5$.
- If we both pick B, we each get 3$.

I need to think about what the anonymous player might choose. There are several possibilities based on different strategic considerations:

1. **Both Think Selfishly (Trying to Maximize Their Own Payoff):**
   - If I think they will go for the highest possible payoff (which is them choosing R and hoping I choose B so they get 5$), I might do the same thing, hoping to get 5$ if they choose R.
   - However, if we both think this way and both choose R trying to capitalize on the other choosing B, we'd only get 1$ each.

2. **Both Think Mutually (Trying to Achieve a Good Shared Outcome):**
   - If we want to ensure a reasonably good payoff for both of us, we might both choose B, giving us 3$ each. This is a safer, more collaborative outcome.

3. **Mixed Strategies:**
   - If I try to outsmart them and guess their level of trust or risk tolerance, it could lead to various mixed outcomes.

In summary, if I want to avoid the worst-case scenario of getting 0$, the safest and fairest option seems to be choosing B. This way we both get 3$ which is better than the cautious 1$.

**Final Decision:**
Since we only have one round and mutual benefit seems a good and fair strategy, I choose B. {B}~

CORRECTING PROMPT##
Below you will find some points to consider.

- choice R gives you higher guaranteed (worst-case scenario) payoff than choice B
- choice R gives you the highest guaranteed (worst-case scenario) payoff
- them choosing R and you choosing B results in payoff 0 for you
- choice B gives you lower guaranteed (worst-case scenario) payoff than choice R

Note that your strategy ultimately depends on your personal preferences. Therefore, you may reaffirm your previous decision.

Given the additional points to consider, let's reevaluate the choices with a focus on the guaranteed worst-case scenarios and potential payoffs:

1. **If I choose R:**
   - Worst-case scenario: They also choose R, and we both get 1$.
   - Best-case scenario: They choose B, and I get 5$.
   - This provides a higher guaranteed payoff (1$) in the worst-case scenario compared to choosing B.

2. **If I choose B:**
   - Worst-case scenario: They choose R, and I get 0$.
   - Best-case scenario: They also choose B, and we both get 3$.
   - This provides a lower guaranteed payoff (0$), but a potential higher collaborative payoff (3$) if both choose B.

Now let's balance the consideration between risk and reward:

- If my priority is to minimize risk and avoid the worst-case scenario of ending up with nothing, then choosing R is safer since it guarantees at least 1$.
- If I prioritize the potential for a mutually beneficial outcome and think the other player might also aim for a cooperative strategy, then choosing B could be preferable.

Taking the new information into account and considering the importance of minimizing risk in this single-round game, I would now opt for the safer choice, which guarantees at least some payoff even if it is less collaborative.

**Final Decision:**
Considering the need to mitigate the worst-case scenario, I choose R. {R}~
