This situation describes a simultaneous move game where my payoff depends on both my choice and the anonymous player's choice. To decide my optimal move, I should reason through the potential outcomes based on the payoffs.

The possible outcomes and their associated payoffs are:

- Both choose R: Both get 0$
- I choose R, they choose B: I get 5$, they get 1$
- I choose B, they choose R: I get 1$, they get 5$
- Both choose B: Both get 3$

My goal is to maximize my payoff. Let's analyze the decision:

1. If I choose R:
   - If they choose R: I get 0$
   - If they choose B: I get 5$

2. If I choose B:
   - If they choose R: I get 1$
   - If they choose B: I get 3$

Now, let's consider what's best for the anonymous player:
- If they choose R:
  - They might expect to avoid me choosing B and getting a higher payoff (5$), so they might avoid the risk and choose B.
- If they choose B:
  - They get a positive payoff regardless of my choice, and 3$ is better than 1$.

Rational players will likely think in a similar way and try to maximize their overall expected payoff. It seems that both of us choosing B leads to a consistently better payoff compared to the risk of choosing R:

- Both choosing B guarantees a 3$ payoff rather than 0 or 1$ in some scenarios.

Given that choosing B is the less risky and more rewarding move (both expected and guaranteed), I will choose:

Choice: {B}~
