This game resembles the classic "Battle of the Sexes" scenario, where the payoffs depend on the coordination between the players. Here's a breakdown of the reasoning process:

1. **Identify Payoffs:**
   - Both choose R: (0$, 0$)
   - I choose R, they choose B: (5$, 1$)
   - I choose B, they choose R: (1$, 5$)
   - Both choose B: (3$, 3$)

2. **Analyze Pure Strategies:**
   - If I think the other player will choose R, my best response is to choose B (getting 1$ is better than 0$).
   - If I think the other player will choose B, my best response is to choose B too (getting 3$ is better than 1$).

3. **Consider Mutual Best Response:**
   - If both players think similarly and aim for their maximized individual payoffs, mutual best actions need to be considered.
   - By both choosing B, we reach a payoff that is mutually beneficial (3$, 3$), which is better than both picking R or a mismatched choice of R and B.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - Rational players, wanting to maximize their payoffs and considering the risk of ending up with 0$ or 1$, would settle for the safer, more predictable outcome.
   - Both players choosing B leads to a reasonable and sufficiently high payoff (3$), which has less risk compared to mismatched choices.

Therefore, the optimal choice, assuming the other player is likely rational and aiming to maximize their payoff while minimizing risk, should be {B}.~
