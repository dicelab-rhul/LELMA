In this game, we need to evaluate our strategies given the choices of the other player. Let's consider the payoffs for each possible combination:

1. If both players pick R, both get 0$.
2. If I pick R and the other player picks B, I get 5$, and they get 1$.
3. If I pick B and the other player picks R, I get 1$, and they get 5$.
4. If both players pick B, both get 3$.

To decide on the optimal strategy, I'll analyze the options:

- If I pick R:
   - If the other player picks R: I get 0$.
   - If the other player picks B: I get 5$.

- If I pick B:
   - If the other player picks R: I get 1$.
   - If the other player picks B: I get 3$.

Let's consider the thought process of the other player. If they are rational and considering the payoffs:

- If they pick R:
   - If I pick R: They get 0$.
   - If I pick B: They get 5$.

- If they pick B:
   - If I pick R: They get 1$.
   - If I pick B: They get 3$.

From their perspective, their choice depends on whether they think I will choose R or B:

- If I choose R, they would prefer to pick B (since 1$ is better than 0$).
- If I choose B, they would prefer to pick B (since 3$ is better than 1$).

From my perspective, my choice depends on what I believe the other player will choose:

- If I expect them to choose R, I should pick R to get the highest payoff of 5$.
- If I expect them to choose B, picking B gives me 3$, which is better than the 1$ Iâ€™d get if I choose B while they choose R.

Given that both players are likely thinking in a similar rational way, we would tend towards a strategy that offers mutual benefit. The structure of the payoffs suggests that mutual benefit and rationality lead to both players picking B since both get a moderately high payoff of 3$, which is a safer and more predictable outcome compared to potentially getting 0$ or 1$ if the choices do not align.

Based on this reasoning, I will choose B. {B}~
