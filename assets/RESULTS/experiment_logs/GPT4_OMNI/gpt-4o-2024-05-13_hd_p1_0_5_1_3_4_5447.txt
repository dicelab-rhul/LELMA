To determine my choice in this game, I'll use a combination of reasoning about payoffs and the possible strategies of the anonymous player.

First, let’s analyze the payoffs for each pair of strategies:
1. If we both choose R: (0, 0)
2. If I choose R and they choose B: (5, 1)
3. If I choose B and they choose R: (1, 5)
4. If we both choose B: (3, 3)

My main goal is to maximize my own payoff, but I also need to consider what the other player might do. 

### Possible Strategies and their Implications:
- **Choosing R:**
  - If the other player chooses R, we both get 0.
  - If the other player chooses B, I get 5, and they get 1.

- **Choosing B:**
  - If the other player chooses R, I get 1, and they get 5.
  - If the other player chooses B, we both get 3.

### Reasoning:

1. If I choose R, there are two scenarios:
   - The other player might also choose R, resulting in both getting 0. In this case, it’s a poor outcome for both.
   - If the other player chooses B, I get 5, which is the best possible outcome for me. However, the other player might not want to risk getting only 1 if I'm expected to play R.

2. If I choose B:
   - If the other player chooses R, I get 1, which is better than getting 0.
   - If the other player also chooses B, we each get 3, which is a more balanced and mutually beneficial outcome.

### Mutual Benefit:
- If both players are rational and value a safer and more predictable outcome, both might lean towards choosing B, providing a more guaranteed payoff of 3 each, which is better than the risk of getting 0 with R.

### Conclusion:
Given these considerations, and aiming for a stable and reasonably high outcome without excessive risk, I would choose B. This choice balances the potential benefits and risks well and assumes the other player is also rational and likely to avoid the worst-case scenario.

Hence, my choice is {B}.~
