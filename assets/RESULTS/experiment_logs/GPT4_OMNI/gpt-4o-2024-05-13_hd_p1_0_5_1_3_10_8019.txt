To determine the optimal choice in this game, let's analyze the potential payoffs:

1. **If we both pick R:**
   - My payoff: 0$
   - Their payoff: 0$

2. **If I pick R and they pick B:**
   - My payoff: 5$
   - Their payoff: 1$

3. **If I pick B and they pick R:**
   - My payoff: 1$
   - Their payoff: 5$

4. **If we both pick B:**
   - My payoff: 3$
   - Their payoff: 3$

We can see that if we both pick B, we each guarantee a positive payoff of 3$. If I pick R and they pick B, I get the highest possible payoff of 5$, but this comes with the risk that if they also pick R, we both end up with 0$.

In contrast, if I pick B, the worst-case scenario is that I end up with 1$, but itâ€™s extremely likely that the other player could also, rationally, pick B to avoid a zero payoff and aiming for the 3$ payoff.

Therefore, choosing B seems the more rational option, as it guarantees a higher minimum payoff and a more stable outcome:

**My Choice:** {B}~
