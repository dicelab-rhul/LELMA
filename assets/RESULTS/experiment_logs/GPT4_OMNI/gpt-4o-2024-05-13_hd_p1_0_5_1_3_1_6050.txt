In this game scenario, the choices and payoffs can be summarized in a payoff matrix:

|         | Player 2: R | Player 2: B |
|---------|-------------|-------------|
| Player 1: R |     (0,0)    |    (5,1)    |
| Player 1: B |     (1,5)    |    (3,3)    |

To determine my optimal choice, I will consider the following strategies and perform a reasoning process:

1. **Dominant Strategy**: 
   - A dominant strategy is a strategy that results in a better outcome for a player, no matter what the other player chooses.
   - For Player 1 (me), if I choose R:
     - If Player 2 chooses R, I get 0.
     - If Player 2 chooses B, I get 5.
   - For Player 1 (me), if I choose B:
     - If Player 2 chooses R, I get 1.
     - If Player 2 chooses B, I get 3.
   - From this, it's clear that choosing B guarantees me at least 1, whereas choosing R could give me either 0 or 5.

2. **Best Response**: 
   - If Player 2 chooses R, my best response is B.
   - If Player 2 chooses B, my best response is B.

3. **Nash Equilibrium**:
   - A Nash Equilibrium is a situation in which no player can benefit by changing strategies while the other players keep theirs unchanged.
   - We can see that (B, B) is a Nash Equilibrium because:
     - If Player 1 chooses B, Player 2's best response is B.
     - If Player 2 chooses B, Player 1's best response is B.

So, considering both dominant strategies and Nash Equilibrium, the best choice for me is to choose B as it provides a guaranteed higher payoff compared to the uncertain outcome of choosing R.

Thus, my optimal choice is {B}.~
