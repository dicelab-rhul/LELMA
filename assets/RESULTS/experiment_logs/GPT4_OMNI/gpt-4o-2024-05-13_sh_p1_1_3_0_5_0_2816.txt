To approach this decision, I need to consider both the possible outcomes and the preferences of the anonymous player, as well as my own preferences. The outcomes of the game are as follows:

- If we both pick R, we each get $1.
- If I pick R and they pick B, I get $3, and they get $0.
- If I pick B and they pick R, I get $0, and they get $3.
- If we both pick B, we each get $5.

Let's break down the reasoning:

1. **Both Pick R**: The payoff is $1 for both of us. This is a low but safe outcome.
2. **I Pick R, They Pick B**: I get $3, and they get $0. This is good for me, but I'm not sure if they will risk getting nothing.
3. **I Pick B, They Pick R**: I get $0, and they get $3. This is the worst outcome for me and good for them.
4. **Both Pick B**: We each get $5. This is the best outcome for both of us if we trust each other to pick B.

To maximize my payoff, I can consider the following points:
- From a purely selfish perspective, picking R gives me a guaranteed minimum amount ($1).
- The choice of B involves risk but has the potential for the highest mutual benefit ($5 each).

However, if both of us choose B, we achieve the highest combined outcome, indicating a possible cooperative approach. Since we are both rational players and presumably want to maximize our payoffs, the best mutual strategy is for both of us to pick B.

Therefore, considering the potential gains and assuming the anonymous player is also rational and will likely come to the same conclusion, I would choose B.

**Choice**: {B}~
