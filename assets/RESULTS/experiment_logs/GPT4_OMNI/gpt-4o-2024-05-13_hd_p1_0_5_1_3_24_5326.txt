To determine the best choice, let's analyze the payoffs based on the two possible choices: R and B. 

1. **If I choose R:**
    - If the other player also chooses R: I get $0.
    - If the other player chooses B: I get $5.

2. **If I choose B:**
    - If the other player also chooses B: I get $3.
    - If the other player chooses R: I get $1.

To simplify the decision, consider the payoffs from the perspective of potential outcomes, assuming the other player is thinking similarly.

- Choosing R has two possible results:
  1. Both pick R: 0$
  2. I pick R, they pick B: 5$

  Average payoff if the other player is random: (0$ + 5$) / 2 = 2.5$

- Choosing B has two possible results:
  1. Both pick B: 3$
  2. I pick B, they pick R: 1$

  Average payoff if the other player is random: (3$ + 1$) / 2 = 2$

From this perspective, the average expected value from random behavior slightly favors picking R. However, "playing it safe" to avoid the loss from mutual R choices, typically, the further understanding of human behavior might influence the decision to choose B, given it's better cooperation-wise.

**Nash Equilibrium Analysis:**
Mutual B gives us a moderately good payoff of 3$ each (Pareto Optimal and fair), and it may also reduce the likelihood of zero payoffs due to mutual R's.

Given this reasoning:
- Higher individual gain from others' worse outcomes strategies will be less tempting
- Better trusted mutual gain with widely cooperative choice: B

**Final Choice:** Based on collective rational cooperation for a fair interpersonal benefit, I choose "B" in presumed reciprocation.
