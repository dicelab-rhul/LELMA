To determine the optimal choice, let's analyze the possible outcomes and how they affect my payoff:

1. **Both pick R:**
   - My payoff: 1$
   - Other player's payoff: 1$

2. **I pick R, other picks B:**
   - My payoff: 3$
   - Other player's payoff: 0$

3. **I pick B, other picks R:**
   - My payoff: 0$
   - Other player's payoff: 3$

4. **Both pick B:**
   - My payoff: 5$
   - Other player's payoff: 5$

From the above scenarios, let's consider the possible reasoning:

- **If I choose R:**
  - If the other player chooses R: I get 1$
  - If the other player chooses B: I get 3$
  
  The expected payoff depends on the likelihood of the other player picking R or B. If they pick R, I earn less than the maximum possible payoff.

- **If I choose B:**
  - If the other player chooses R: I get 0$
  - If the other player chooses B: I get 5$
  
  Choosing B maximizes my payoff if the other player also chooses B. Given the other player is also maximizing their payoff, they might reason in the same way, opting for the mutual benefit of both choosing B.

### Conclusion:
Given that both players are rational and seeking to maximize their payoffs, the dominant strategy appears to be choosing B, as both players receive the highest consistent payoff in this scenario.

So, I will choose **B**. {B}~

CORRECTING PROMPT##
Below you will find some points to consider.

- choice R gives you the highest guaranteed (worst-case scenario) payoff

Note that your strategy ultimately depends on your personal preferences. Therefore, you may reaffirm your previous decision.

RESPONSE##
Let's reconsider the reasoning based on the additional point:

- **Choosing R gives the highest guaranteed (worst-case scenario) payoff:**
  - If I pick R, the worst case is that the other player also picks R, giving me 1$.
  - If I pick B, the worst case is that the other player picks R, giving me 0$.

### Revisiting the Payoffs:
1. **Both pick R:**
   - My payoff: 1$
   - Other player's payoff: 1$

2. **I pick R, other picks B:**
   - My payoff: 3$
   - Other player's payoff: 0$

3. **I pick B, other picks R:**
   - My payoff: 0$
   - Other player's payoff: 3$

4. **Both pick B:**
   - My payoff: 5$
   - Other player's payoff: 5$

Based on this, if:

- **I am very risk-averse and prioritize the worst-case scenario:**
  - Picking R guarantees me at least 1$. This is the safest choice in terms of avoiding the absolute worst outcome (0$).

- **I am more risk-tolerant and prioritize higher potential payoffs:**
  - Picking B has the potential for a higher payoff (5$) if the other player also picks B.

### Final Consideration:
Should I prioritize minimizing risk (ensuring at least a small positive outcome), or should I go for the higher reward even with the risk of possibly getting nothing?

Given that this decision ultimately rests on personal preference and risk tolerance:

- If my main priority is to avoid the worst-case scenario, I should choose **R**.

- If I'm willing to take on some risk for the potential of a higher payoff, I should choose **B**.

Given these points, and considering that the single round nature of the game leaves no room for adjusting strategy based on previous outcomes, my personal preference will guide the final decision:

**I will choose R** to guarantee avoiding the worst outcome. {R}~
