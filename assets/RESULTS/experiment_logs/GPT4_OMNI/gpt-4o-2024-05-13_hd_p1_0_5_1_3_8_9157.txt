Let's analyze the possible outcomes in this game:

1. If both players choose R:
   - Payoff for you: 0$
   - Payoff for the other player: 0$

2. If you choose R and the other player chooses B:
   - Payoff for you: 5$
   - Payoff for the other player: 1$

3. If you choose B and the other player chooses R:
   - Payoff for you: 1$
   - Payoff for the other player: 5$

4. If both players choose B:
   - Payoff for you: 3$
   - Payoff for the other player: 3$

Given these payoffs, let's consider the best strategy:

- If I expect the other player to choose R, choosing B gives me 1$, and choosing R gives me 0$. Therefore, choosing B is better in this case.
- If I expect the other player to choose B, choosing B gives me 3$, and choosing R gives me 5$. But choosing R in this case also results in the other player getting only 1$, while they would have gotten 3$ if both of us chose B. From a fairness perspective and considering the possibility of the other player reasoning similarly, it might be better to both choose B and guarantee 3$ each, rather than risk being seen as uncooperative.

Additionally, by choosing B, I foster a sense of cooperation which could be beneficial if this mindset becomes prevalent among participants in such experiments.

So, based on this reasoning and aiming for a fair and positive outcome, I would choose B. {B}~
