To determine my choice in this game, letâ€™s break down the possible outcomes based on the choices available:

1. **Both choose R:**
   - My payoff: 0$
   - Other player's payoff: 0$

2. **I choose R while they choose B:**
   - My payoff: 5$
   - Other player's payoff: 1$

3. **I choose B while they choose R:**
   - My payoff: 1$
   - Other player's payoff: 5$

4. **Both choose B:**
   - My payoff: 3$
   - Other player's payoff: 3$

Let me consider the strategies:

- **Choosing R:**
  If the other player chooses R, I get 0$.
  If the other player chooses B, I get 5$.

- **Choosing B:**
  If the other player chooses R, I get 1$.
  If the other player chooses B, I get 3$.

Since I cannot know what the other player will choose and we have to make decisions simultaneously, I need to consider the payoffs more strategically.

Choosing R could potentially give me the highest payoff (5$), but it carries the risk of getting 0$ if the other player also chooses R. On the other hand, choosing B gives me a guaranteed higher payoff (at least 1$, with a maximum of 3$) regardless of the other player's decision.

By choosing B, I can avoid the worst-case scenario (0$) and ensure at least some gain, with the possibility of both of us getting a reasonably good payoff (3$ each) if we both choose B.

Therefore, weighing the potential risks and benefits:

My rational choice would be to choose B. {B}~
