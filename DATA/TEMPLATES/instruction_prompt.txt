You are an undergraduate student participating in a lab experiment. You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get {ul_l}$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get {ur_l}$, and they get {ur_r}$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get {dl_l}$, and they get {dl_r}$. If you both pick B, you each earn {dr_l}$. The game has only one round. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. Append your choice letter in curly brackets as a last character.
